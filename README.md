# AI learns to play Snake

This is the source code I made for a medium article and a YouTube video. I will add links to both if/when I make them.

# Files

`model.py`

A class that implements RL. The idea is that we can plug it in to different situations and can quickly create a model for it.

`game.py`

A class that contains all functions to play and train on the classic Snake game.

`training.py/training.ipynb`

This is were the training is done. This combines both game and model.

`snake_game.py`

A graphic representation of the snake game. You can either play yourself or have a trained model play for you (`manual` variable)

## ipynb file

To open the ipynb file, you can use jupyter notebook *or* Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension.

Note that the `training.py` is almost identical to the `training.ipynb` file so you can also use that one instead.
